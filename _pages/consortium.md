Paderborn University (UPB) will be represented within the project by the Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing (PC²). PC² was founded in 1991 as an interdisciplinary institute of UPB and since then has established a reputation as a competence centre for parallel and distributed computing and innovative computer architecture. Two research groups whose heads are affiliated with PC² will contribute to the project.

The [High-Performance IT Systems group](http://cs.uni-paderborn.de/hit) headed by Prof. Christian Plessl contributes expertise in the area of design methods and application of FPGA-based custom computing technology to scientific computing problems.

The [Theoretical Electrical Engineering Group](http://tet.uni-paderborn.de) headed by Prof. Jens Förstner contributes expertise in the area of the theoretical description and simulation of photonic and optoelectronic systems. The key expertise of the group is to combine advance material models with state-of-the-art numerical simulation methods of electromagnetic fields.

The role of UPB in the HighPerMeshes project is:
* project coordination
* providing a computational nanophotonics code and case studies
* contribution to design and validation of domain-specific language
* develop domain-specific code generation and optimization strategies for FPGAs
* validate results with FPGAs

Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU) is a strong research university and one of the largest universities in Germany, with 40,000 students and 4,000 academic staff (including over 570 professors).

HighPerMeshes' project partner at FAU is the [Chair of Hardware/Software Co-Design](https://cs12.cms.rrze.uni-erlangen.de/). Here, the Architecture and Compiler Design (ACD) group headed by Dr. Frank Hannig contributes expert knowledge in the fields of domain-specific computing and programming languages, as well as compilation techniques for parallel processor architectures including accelerators.

The role of FAU in the HighPerMeshes project is:
* design of a domain-specific compiler front-end and intermediate representation
* development of compiler infrastructure for transformation and optimization
* development of OpenCL code generation backend

The [Fraunhofer Institute for Industrial Mathematics ITWM](https://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/en) at Kaiserslautern is one of currently 66 institutes of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, an application-oriented research organization. Fraunhofer ITWM focuses on the development of mathematical applications for industry, technology and economy. Mathematical approaches to practical  challenges are the specific competences of the institute and complement knowledge in engineering and economics in an optimal way.

The [Competence Center High Performance Computing](http://www.itwm.fraunhofer.de/abteilungen/hpc.html)
contributes expertise in the development and application of innovative new software tools like the communication library GPI-2 for the efficient and highly scalable implementation of parallel software.

The role of ITWM in the HighPerMeshes project is:
* development of code transformations for GPI-2 based interprocess communication and synchronization
* development of problem partitioning strategies for large-scale clusters
* providing task models for load balancing within a compute node and within the cluster

The Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) is a non-university research institute of the State of Berlin. In close interdisciplinary cooperation with the Berlin universities and scientific institutions Zuse Institute implements research and development in the field of information technology with a particular focus on application-oriented algorithmic mathematics and practical computer science. ZIB also provides high-performance computer capacity as an accompanying service.

In the [Supercomputing](http://www.zib.de/institute/parallel-and-distributed-computing/supercomputing) department advanced programming tools and flexible runtime environments for complex application settings are developed targeting emerging technologies like heterogeneous many-core systems.

The [Numerical Mathematics](http://www.zib.de/numeric) department develops efficient modelling, simulation, and optimization tools and algorithms for challenging application problems from medicine, systems biology, molecular dynamics and nano-optical systems.

The role of ZIB in the HighPerMeshes project is:

* providing the Kaskade FE toolbox reference code and case studies
* contribution to design and validation of domain-specific language
* develop domain-specific code generation and optimization strategies
  for multi- and many-cores (Xeon, Xeon Phi) and GPU (OpenCL)
* design of intermediate representation for communication and task
  offloading
* validate results with multi- and many-cores
