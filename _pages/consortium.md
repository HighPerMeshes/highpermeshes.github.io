Paderborn University (UPB) will be represented within the project by the Paderborn Center for Parallel Computing (PC²). PC² was founded in 1991 as an interdisciplinary institute of UPB and since then has established a reputation as a competence centre for parallel and distributed computing and innovative computer architecture. Two research groups whose heads are affiliated with PC² will contribute to the project.

The [High-Performance IT Systems group](http://cs.uni-paderborn.de/hit) headed by Prof. Christian Plessl contributes expertise in the area of design methods and application of FPGA-based custom computing technology to scientific computing problems.

The [Theoretical Electrical Engineering Group](http://tet.uni-paderborn.de) headed by Prof. Jens Förstner contributes expertise in the area of the theoretical description and simulation of photonic and optoelectronic systems. The key expertise of the group is to combine advance material models with state-of-the-art numerical simulation methods of electromagnetic fields.

The role of UPB in the HighPerMeshes project is:
* project coordination
* providing a computational nanophotonics code and case studies
* contribution to design and validation of domain-specific language
* develop domain-specific code generation and optimization strategies for FPGAs
* validate results with FPGAs

The Zuse Institute Berlin (ZIB) is a non-university research institute of the State of Berlin. In close interdisciplinary cooperation with the Berlin universities and scientific institutions Zuse Institute implements research and development in the field of information technology with a particular focus on application-oriented algorithmic mathematics and practical computer science. ZIB also provides high-performance computer capacity as an accompanying service.

In the [Supercomputing](http://www.zib.de/institute/parallel-and-distributed-computing/supercomputing) department advanced programming tools and flexible runtime environments for complex application settings are developed targeting emerging technologies like heterogeneous many-core systems.

The [Numerical Mathematics](http://www.zib.de/numeric) department develops efficient modelling, simulation, and optimization tools and algorithms for challenging application problems from medicine, systems biology, molecular dynamics and nano-optical systems.

The role of ZIB in the HighPerMeshes project is:

* providing the Kaskade FE toolbox reference code and case studies
* contribution to design and validation of domain-specific language
* develop domain-specific code generation and optimization strategies
  for multi- and many-cores (Xeon, Xeon Phi) and GPU (OpenCL)
* design of intermediate representation for communication and task
  offloading
* validate results with multi- and many-cores
